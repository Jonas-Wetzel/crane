(* A module with more than one inductive makes a function over [wrap]
   eligible for methodification: it is emitted as a member of [wrap]'s struct.
   The member name is the Rocq name, unchanged -- but the struct already has
   members Crane generated for it.  Two of them are reachable from ordinary
   Rocq identifiers:

     Definition v         -> clashes with the accessor   const variant_t &v() const
     Definition variant_t -> clashes with the type alias using variant_t = ...

   A user-chosen Rocq name must not be able to collide with a generated
   member, so a methodified constant is renamed away from them -- [v] becomes
   [v0] and [variant_t] becomes [variant_t0] -- the same treatment the factory
   names get via [factory_name_of_ctor]. *)
