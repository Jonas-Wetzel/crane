(** An instance method that discards its argument ([fun _ => 1]) loses the
    argument on the way out: the method is emitted nullary while the concept
    still requires the one-argument shape, so the instance fails the concept's
    [static_assert] and its own body mentions the now-unbound template
    parameter [T1].  The same class with a method that actually matches on its
    argument comes out right, so this is the erasure of an unused parameter,
    not the class machinery. *)
