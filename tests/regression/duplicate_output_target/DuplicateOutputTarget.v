(** Two [Crane Extraction] commands naming the same output file used to
    silently overwrite one another: the second unit's header and implementation
    replaced the first's, with no warning, so the declarations of the first
    module were simply gone.  The second command is now refused; the modules
    have to be named in one command, or given targets of their own.

    The substantive assertions run while DuplicateOutputTarget.vo is built. *)
