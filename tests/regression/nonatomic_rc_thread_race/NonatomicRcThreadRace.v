(* [Set Crane NonAtomicRc] is a promise that the extracted program is
   single-threaded, so its reference counts need no atomics.  This unit breaks
   that promise: it also uses [Monads.Thread], and two spawned threads share an
   inductive value, so a non-atomic count would be lost and the cells freed
   while still reachable.

   Crane does not take the promise on trust.  A unit that reaches a custom
   extraction spelled in terms of <thread> keeps [std::shared_ptr], and says so
   with the [crane-non-atomic-rc-concurrent] warning.  The program below is
   pure and uses no axioms; it must run cleanly under the sanitizers. *)
