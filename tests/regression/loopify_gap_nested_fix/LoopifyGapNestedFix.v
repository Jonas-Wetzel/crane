(** An inner [fix] that calls the outer function.

    [rose_sum] folds over a rose tree's children with a nested [fix sum_list]
    that recurses back into the outer [rose_sum].  The nested fixpoint is
    adopted as a second entry point of [rose_sum]'s frame machine, so both
    recursions push onto one stack and the extracted [rose_sum] has no C++
    self-call. *)
