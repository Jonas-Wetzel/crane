(** Every inductive's C++ struct declares members of its own — [v], [v_],
    [v_mut], [clone] and [variant_t].  A user name that lands beside them in
    that struct must be renamed, but two spellings are not:

    - a constructor field named [clone] becomes a data member [clone] beside
      the generated [clone()], which C++ rejects as a redefinition;

    - an inductive named [clone] gives a struct [clone] whose generated
      [clone()] then reads as a constructor with a return type. *)
