(** A constant defined in one extraction unit and used from another is not
    referenced across the unit boundary: instead of including the library's
    header, the consuming unit re-declares [Lib] and re-emits the body of
    [Lib.len] in its own .cpp.  Linking the two units together then fails with
    a duplicate symbol for [Lib::len]. *)
