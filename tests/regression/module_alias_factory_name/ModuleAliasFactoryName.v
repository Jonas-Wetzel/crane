(** A module alias is transparent to Rocq but not to the factory-method namer:
    reached through the alias [A], the constructor [c] of [Lib.t] is called as
    [A::t::c0(...)], while the type declares the factory as [c].  Using [Lib]
    directly works; only the aliased path gets the [0] suffix. *)
