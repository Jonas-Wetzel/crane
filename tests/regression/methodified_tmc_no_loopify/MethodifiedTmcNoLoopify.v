(* [Set Crane Loopify] must reach a recursive function that was methodified.
   A module with more than one inductive makes [wraps] eligible, and the
   method it becomes calls itself on a moved-from receiver -- [std::move] of
   the object [this] points at.  That is a cast, not a temporary, so the
   loopifier can park the receiver's address in a frame like any other; it
   used to read the move as a value receiver and decline, leaving an unbounded
   C++ recursion that overflows the stack at depth 100000. *)
