(** [Mapping.Std] maps [PrimFloat.float] to [double] but leaves the primitive
    constants of that type unmapped, so each one extracts to a C++ constant
    initialised from itself:

      static inline const double infinity = infinity;

    which reads its own storage before it is initialised.  The program compiles
    and runs, and [infinity] and [nan] silently hold zero instead of the values
    they name. *)
