(** A constructor field takes its name from the Rocq binder.  When that name is
    also the name of a type in scope at the field's declaration — here the
    enclosing inductive [t] itself — the member declaration hides the type, and
    every later use of the bare type name in the same struct stops naming a
    type.  The field's name has to be renamed away from the types visible
    beside it. *)
