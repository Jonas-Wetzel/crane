(** A user inductive called [Comparison] and the standard library's
    [comparison] (returned by [Nat.compare]) are emitted under the same C++
    name, and the later declaration wins.  The match on [Nat.compare]'s result
    then looks for [LT] in the user's type: "no member named 'LT' in
    'UserInductiveShadowsStdlib::Comparison'".  The two types are unrelated in
    Rocq; only their emitted names collide. *)
