(** A type defined in a sibling module is spelled relative to the extraction
    target in the generated [.cpp], not relative to the enclosing namespace:
    the out-of-line definition of [f] says [SiblingModuleTypeQualified::Lib::t]
    even though [Lib] is a sibling of the target, giving "no member named
    'Lib'".  The header, which spells the same type from inside the namespace,
    is fine — only the [.cpp] disagrees.  Nesting the defining module deepens
    the wrong prefix but does not change it. *)
