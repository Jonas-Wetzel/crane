(** Eliminators applied directly are lifted into anonymous helpers, and every
    one of them is named [_anon_F].  Two in the same file collide — here
    [nat_rect] and [list_rect] become one overload set and neither call
    matches — and one used from a sibling module is not visible there at all
    ("use of undeclared identifier '_anon_F'").  A single lifted helper in a
    single module works, so the defect is the name, not the lifting. *)
