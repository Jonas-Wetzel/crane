(** A constructor's factory method takes its name by lowercasing the
    constructor, without asking the naming oracle for a fresh one.  Two
    independent sources of collision follow, and both are expected to be
    resolved by renaming the factory, not by emitting a clash:

    - [lst] is methodified, so the definition [nil] lands inside the same
      struct as the factory for [Nil].  Both take no argument, so they differ
      only in return type, which C++ refuses to overload.

    - [Cons] and [CONS] differ only in case, so they lowercase to one factory
      name and the second declaration redeclares the first. *)
