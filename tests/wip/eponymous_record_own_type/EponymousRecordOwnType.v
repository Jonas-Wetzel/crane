(** An inductive whose name matches its enclosing module gets the module's C++
    namespace renamed out of the way, so the type and the namespace do not
    collide.  A record does not: its struct is emitted as the module struct
    itself, and a constant of that record's type then becomes an in-class
    static data member of the very type being defined, which is incomplete at
    that point. *)
