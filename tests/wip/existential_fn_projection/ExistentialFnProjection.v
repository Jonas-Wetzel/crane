(** The second component of a [sigT] is stored at the erased type [std::any],
    because the first component is a [Type].  Projecting it out therefore has
    to cast it back to the type the projection's position expects.  It does
    not: the [std::any] is used directly, as a callee when the payload is a
    function and as a value when it is data. *)
